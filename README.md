# CodeCademy Excursion project
## Introduction
This is the "Excursion" project from the CodeCademy Full-Stack Engineer Skill Path. It contains a simple website made with HTML & CSS.
## Who is this for?
I'm pretty new to HTML & CSS and this repository has mainly been created for me to get better at git. If you are another CodeCademy learner feel free to look at, criticize and review the website.
## Images
Some images have been removed for copyright reasons. Might be free, just to be safe. If you wanna watch the website I recommend you get the needed images from [here](https://content.codecademy.com/programs/freelance-one/excursion/images/camp.jpg) and [here](https://content.codecademy.com/programs/freelance-one/excursion/images/phone.png) as well as the video from [here](https://content.codecademy.com/programs/freelance-one/excursion/videos/excursion.mp4) and put them in resources/images and resources/videos. Links are provided by Codecademy, message me if they don't work.
